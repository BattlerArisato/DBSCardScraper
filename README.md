# DBSCardScraper

A simple Discord bot made to search for cards for the DBS Card Game through web scraping.

This bot works by searching info on TCGPlayer, so whenever TCGPlayer updates it card database the bot should do it too.
This does mean though that if TCGPlayer updates it own web interface the bot would need an update. Let's hope that does not happens soon.

The bot does work with "?" as a prefix, just start your message with ? and then add the name of the card

For Example:

?Protector of the People.

Hope this bot helps you with the lazyness of going to look for cards and it's effect on the dbs page or on tcgplayer.
